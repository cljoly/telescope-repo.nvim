`telescope-repo` is an extension for [telescope.nvim][] that searches the filesystem for *git* (or other SCM[^1], like *Pijul*, *Mercurial*…) repositories. It does not require any setup: the list of repositories is built on the fly over your whole `$HOME`, you don’t need to manually add projects or open some folders to populate this list, as opposed to [telescope-project.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-project.nvim) or [project.nvim](https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/project.nvim).

Use cases include:
* If you don’t start vim from the shell (from a GUI or as the start command of a terminal), you are most likely in your `$HOME` directory. You then want to jump into your code as quickly as possible and this plugin can help!
* Sometimes, you have the definition of a function and use of it in different repositories  (e.g. a library you wrote and a program using this library). This plugin helps to open the two, for instance in two splits.
* Use of less popular SCMs: some similar extensions rely on strong conventions to find repositories, like “directories containing a `.git` file that is also a directory, all inside directory `X`”. Less popular SCMs like [Pijul][] have a different folder name, and even [`git worktree`][worktree]s don’t fit neatly into these constraint, with their `.git` *files*.

`telescope-repo.nvim` is based on [telescope-ghq.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ghq.nvim)

## Installation

You need to add these in your plugin management system:
```lua
'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
'cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim'
```
And optionally, to load the extension:
```lua
require'telescope'.load_extension'repo'
```

A handy companion plugin is [vim-rooter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter), as it’ll change the current directory according to the current file’s detected project (often, the root of the git repository).

### Packer

For instance, with [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):
```lua
use 'cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim'
use {
  'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
  requires = { {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'} }
}
```

## External Dependencies

### Required

* [`fd`][] to find the repositories on the filesystem with `list`
* [`plocate`][] or [`locate`][] to find the repositories on the filesystem with `cached_list`

[`fd`]: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
[`locate`]: https://man.archlinux.org/man/locate.1
[`plocate`]: https://man.archlinux.org/man/plocate.1

### Optional

* [`glow`][] to preview markdown files, will fall back to [`bat`][] if not present (and uses `cat` if neither are present)

[`glow`]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow
[`bat`]: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

## Usage

### list

`:Telescope repo list` or `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{}`

Running `repo list` and list repositories' paths.

| key              | action               |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `<CR>` (edit)    | `builtin.git_files` for git, falls back to `builtin.find_files` for other SCMs |

#### Options

##### `bin`

Filepath for the binary `fd`.

```vim
" path can be expanded
:Telescope repo list bin=~/fd
```

##### `pattern`

Pattern of the SCM database folder.

Default value: `[[^\.git$]]`

##### `cwd`

Transform the result paths into relative ones with this value as the base dir.

Default value: `vim.fn.getcwd()`

##### `fd_opts`

**This is a relatively advanced option that you should use with caution. There is no guarantee that a particular set of options would work the same across multiple versions**

This passes additional options to the command `fd` that generates the repository list. It is inserted like so:

```
fd [set of default options] [fd_opts] --exec [some default command] [pattern] …
```

##### Example

Let’s say you have a git repository `S` inside another git repository `M` (for instance because of [#5](https://github.com/cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim/issues/5)), but `S` is in a directory that’s ignored in the `.gitignore` in `M`. `S` wouldn’t appear in the Telescope list of this extension by default, because it is ignored (`.gitignore` are taken into account by default).

To avoid taking into account the `.gitignore`, we need to pass `--no-ignore-vcs` to `fd`, like so (in NeoVim):

```
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{fd_opts={'--no-ignore-vcs'}}
```

This will list `M` and `S` in the Telescope output! The downside is that listing repositories will be a little longer, as we don’t skip the git-ignored files anymore.

##### `tail_path`

Show only basename of the path.

Default value: `false`

##### `shorten_path`

Call `pathshorten()` for each path. This will for instance transform `/home/me/code/project` to `/h/m/c/project`.

Default value: `false`

#### Examples

Here is how you can use this plugin with various SCM:

| SCM    | Command                                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| git    | `:Telescope repo list` or `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{}`  |
| pijul  | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.pijul$]]}`       |
| hg     | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.hg$]]}`          |
| fossil | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.fslckout$]]}`    |

Is your favorite SCM missing? It should be straightforward to support it by changing the pattern parameter. If you want it to be considered for addition here, open a PR!

### cached_list

`:Telescope repo cached_list`

This relies on a `locate` command to find repositories. This should be much faster than the `list` command, as it relies on a pre-built index but results may be stalled.

*Note*: at this point, the plugin does not manage index update. Updating the index often requires to run a command like `updatedb` as root.

#### Troubleshooting

You should try to run:
```
sudo updatedb
```
if you encounter any problems. If it’s not the case by default, you should automate such index update with for instance `cron` or `systemd-timers`. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locate.

#### Options

Options are the similar to `repo list`, bearing in mind that we use `locate` instead of `fd`. Note that:

* `fd_opts` is not supported, as we don’t use `fd`

#### Examples

##### Exclude Irrelevant Results

Chances are you will get results from folders you don’t care about like `.cache` or `.cargo`. In that case, you can use the `file_ignore_patterns` option of Telescope, like so (these are [Lua regexes](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1)).

Hide all git repositories that may be in `.cache` or `.cargo`:
```lua
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.cached_list{file_ignore_patterns={"/%.cache/", "/%.cargo/"}}
```
###### Notes

* These patterns are used to filter the output of the `locate` command, so they don’t speed up the search in any way. You should use them mainly to exclude git repositories you won’t want to jump into, not in the hope to enhance performance.
* The `%.` in Lua regex is an escaped `.` as `.` matches any characters.
* These patterns are applied against whole paths like `/home/myuser/.cache/some/dir`, so if you want to exclude only `/home/myuser/.cache`, you need a more complicated pattern like so:
```lua
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.cached_list{file_ignore_patterns={"^".. vim.env.HOME .. "/%.cache/", "^".. vim.env.HOME .. "/%.cargo/"}}
```

##### Use With Other SCMs

Here is how you can use this plugin with various SCM (we match on the whole path with `locate`, so patterns differ slightly from `repo list`: notice the `^` that becomes a `/`):

| SCM    | Command                                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| git    | `:Telescope repo list` or `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{}`  |
| pijul  | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[/\.pijul$]]}`       |
| hg     | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[/\.hg$]]}`          |
| fossil | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[/\.fslckout$]]}`    |

## FAQ

### Getting the repository list is slow

If `:Telescope repo list` is slow, you can use your `.fdignore` to exclude some folders from your filesystem. . You can even use a custom ignore file with the `--ignore-file` option, like so:
```
lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{fd_opts=[[--ignore-file=myignorefile]]}
```
